# Instructions 
1. Copy the files locally to your machine.
I reccomend using: `git clone https://github.com/AveryData/hp-pred`

1. Open to the correct folder "hp-pred" in a command prompt 
2. Create a virtual environment for the project using the following command:`conda create -n myenv python=3.8`. Note that FBProphet does not work well in newer versions of python
3. Activate the venv by typing `activate myenv`
4. Install the required packages using pip by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Launch the Streamlit app by running the following command: `streamlit run app.py`
